        My favorite memory of Gav and I is when we first met, for our first PE class there was an issue with our assigned room and I aproached her if that was the correct room because i was only passing by to go the bathroom and noticed her because we were blockmates because and last time i remembered we were assigned  to another room so i asked her to check if it was correct ever since then we became friends.
