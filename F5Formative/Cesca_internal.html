    <h2>Favorite Memory</h2>
    <p>My favorite memory of cesca is when she was trying to hide from her friend 
        because we were gonna eat at Jolibee and they didnt want to include them 
        because they were annoyed at him that time so i found it funny that her friend 
        was looking for her but she hid and avoided to be seen by him till we got to Jolibee.</p>
