    <h2>Favorite Memory</h2>
    <p>My favorite memory of cesca is when she was trying to hide from her friend because we were gonna eat at Jolibee and they didnt want to include them because they were annoyed at him that time so i found it funny that her friend was looking for her but she hid and avoided to be seen by him till we got to Jolibee.</p>
